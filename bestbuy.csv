0,Fire,5,OLED is worth it,1 week ago,"I love my switch. The quality is way better than the first switch, and definitely worth the money. Finally get to play all of the Mario, DK, Zelda games I grew up with. I guess the only downside is that you can’t play the old Pokémon games.",1,0
1,fairymichy,5,Switch Oled is a huge upgrade!,2 days ago,"The oled is shockingly clear for the price point. Colors are great they are just so vibrant and the shading and dark areas seem to pop so much more, speakers are better; it's totally worth it.",0,0
2,josh,4,Nice upgrade from the first Switch!,1 month ago,"I bought the original version of the switch, so this has been a very welcome upgrade. I play handheld much more than on the TV and the new display has been awesome! My only complaint is it is easy to transfer your switch over to the OLED, you still need to plug in game cards/ download everything so your new switch has all your stuff on it. The “Transfer” makes it look like nothing got moved and all your save data is gone , I freaked out at first. Now that I got all my games and save data back up I love the new model.",0,0
3,Hyperius,5,great!,8 months ago,"The OLED screen is far better than the nintendo switch lite I had before. The product itself is twice as big. I'm a very satisfied customer. The device itself had one small little scuff/scratch on it which sucked opening it to find that. The box looked like it had been in a few battles, maybe on the pallets or rough handling of the box in store. Overall great product though!",7,3
4,ZaidSteve,5,The upgrade is a must,7 months ago,"Honestly I was hesitant to make an upgrade to my Switch model 2018 Mario edition. But I got a chance to get my hands on the OLED version and decided to proceed and upgrade. The upgrade is not a minor but it offers some upgrades that are needed, more specifically the screen size and the picture quality and the kickstand received an upgrade and seems durable compared to the old one that broke after a month. Great buy.",2,0

14,BrittM,5,Simply A Gorgeous Console,8 months ago,"I am over the moon satisfied with the OLED Switch! I never owned the first Switch model but have played on a friend's. I can definitely say purchasing the OLED for the extra money is well worth it. The increased size of the screen is fantastic for a handheld console and the OLED black is just jaw-droppingly beautiful. I love the joy-cons to controller feature as well as it makes the jump from Xbox to the Switch very smooth. The joy-cons are also comfortable by themselves. I would have to say they fit in your hand nicer than the Wii remote did, in my opinion. Nintendo just did everything right with the OLED console.  My TV is also an OLED so the transition from playing on the go to on the big screen incredible. The kickstand is wonderful. Makes playing super smooth and sharing your screen easy when friends are watching. The only thing I would suggest to Nintendo is that they make the HDMI cable longer. It is rather short and made it hard to keep my cable management clutter-free. 
Note: the top left corner has a bubble from when I put the screen protector I purchased on. There is nothing wrong with the screen itself. I play a good majority on the TV so I'm not too bothered by the bubble at the present time. I would highly recommend a screen protector so that you do not have to worry about the screen getting damaged as you slide the console into the docking station.",1,0

If you’re unsure about upgrading due to already having a switch and moving onto the OLED I highly recommend it.",12,10

25,Pons,5,Beautiful vibrant OLED,1 year ago,"It’s hard to show in pictures how beautiful the screen on this Nintendo Switch is. You have to see it for yourself in person. If you’re reading this, I’m going to assume you already own a switch or switch lite. I happened to own a Og day 1 Nintendo switch and a switch lite, and I knew I wanted this OLED switch the minute they announced it. OLED screens are a technical marvel and are truly beautiful. I like many others am a little disappointed that the switch didn’t get a new processor for better performance but I am still happy with my purchase. The screen alone makes all the games look beautiful. Colors are vivid and contrast is amazing. When you play it in a dark room, the screen looks like it’s off when a black scene is displayed. Besides the new screen, there isn’t a whole lot new with this switch, the dock was improved a little along with the kickstand on the back. That is also a welcome update as the old models always tended to fall over because the kickstand was weak and small. Games still load a little slow, when compared to phones and newer consoles, so don’t expect a speed increase. It comes with the same power adapter and joycon grip as before. Would I recommend this? Yes and No. if you love your Nintendo switch and want the new beautiful screen, then I think you’ll be very happy buying it. If you’re ok with the screen quality of the older models and want to save money, then don’t rush out and buy it. Not much has changed. If you’re on the fence, try to get your hands on one to see the display in person.",43,18

Much better than it’s predecessor. I think I will be playing the  handheld version a little more often.",6,8

41,HalfAMind,3,Nintendo Switch OLED,10 months ago,I say it’s average. If you have a switch already your not missing much. A little bigger screen. Same system setup. I guess it has a more clean feel to it and lighter weight. Nintendo should have included a case for it though. And a screen protector. But you can get one later. If you do get this please before you use it get a tempered glass screen protector. Just so it’s safe. I would of liked to see more options with this. They could of added a lot to it. But if your going to get one no matter how many reviews you read. I say you better use it. Don’t let it sit around collecting dust. Enjoy it. Alright I guess that’s all there is to say about. Oh and it has a better stand in the back.  I like how they put the words OLED to it because if you give a quick glance it says OLD lol and I thought that fit cause it is the same thing as the old one. Just a slightly bigger screen.,2,3

Comes with double system capacity space at 64gb but I always buy extra space, good if you buy a lot of digital games too. Love the color as well and it has a slightly bigger screen. Other than that I think it preforms like the original so if you have the extra 50 bucks to spend then I’d go for this one. I also bought a nice cover on it which matches the color quite well!",0,0

67,Micheal,5,"Small Change, Monumental Difference",1 year ago,"For portable players, this upgrade is a huge one, the increased size and quality of the display, the new Kickstand and Speakers add up to a great value!

The Contrast and Colors on the screen make me want to go back and play all the games in my library just to see how much bigger and better they look in portable now. The blacks are true black, and the general picture just pops significantly more and it really must be seen in person to appreciate. The size of the screen is also insane, while only about an inch bigger, in real use it feels WAYYYYYY more sizable and immersive.

The Kickstand is similar to a Surface Pro, infinitely adjustable and reliable, doesn't fall off If you look at it wrong thank god.

The speakers seem much clearer and louder but I haven't compared side by side.

Also, the Dock is quite nice to look at, added Ethernet is a bonus as well!",6,1

He kept raving about the larger screen and how the colors are so vibrant. He also enjoys using it docked on the 65"" for playing his favorite games. The only downside is its a bit uncomfortable to hold in your hands for long stretches of gaming so he shelled out for a wireless ZELDA controller (his fav character). Other than that, can't say enough good things about this OLED switch. Highly recommend it!",1,0

The only changes I’ve seen on this switch is the HD screen, the location of the microSD goes , the kickstand ( much better than the previous Nintendo Switch) and an internal 64GB. The speaker could’ve been a little better but overall this Nintnedo switch is awesome.  I couldn’t get the black and white color but this blue and red neon is as great looking. I will recommend that you leave the protecting adhesive film that came with and also you should get a screen protection for the screen since it’s made out of glass.",2,5

The bezel is smaller, screen = bigger, sound is louder but not better in any other way that I can tell so far. My absolute favorite part about this model is the OLED screen. I tested it by waiting for parts in a game like Yugioh or Super Smash Bros and put my thumb in front of the dark part. I could not see the silhouette of my thumb AT ALL. The black colors are totally black coming from this screen, and I freaking LOVE IT!! Everything pops!! (Don’t let the picture fool you, it’s much better in person, I can promise you that)",0,13

No better graphics or anything.. But! I really love the bigger screen, speakers and the colors popping out. It makes the games look 100x better.

The sound is great, but honestly, I don’t notice too much of a difference. The white Joycons are clean and crisp.

The stand is so much better. It’s not flimsy. On airplanes, when I tried to have it stay up on the tray, no good. This new stand works like a charm.

The kickstand is super nice and the whole console itself  just has an overall more premium feel too it. Best Buy was the only place I could find with a decent amount of consoles in stock.

If you don’t have a switch yet. Pick this up!
If you already have a switch and money isn’t an issue, sure go ahead and upgrade. You deserve to treat yourself!

130,NJuice,5,Vast Improvement for Handheld Players,1 year ago,"I have been a user of the original Nintendo Switch for years now and its easily been one of my favorite video game consoles I have owned! I was excited to get my hands on the new OLED switch, and so far I have not been let down!

ORIGINAL VS OLED (HANDHELD MODE)
- Simply put, the new OLED switch is better than the original in almost every area! Right out of the box you can see the big improvements and its well worth it.
- The larger screen makes handheld gaming feel more immersive and having small bezels makes it feel more modern.
- The OLED screen is truly a game changer. It’s insanely brighter, the colors pop which really makes games feel so vibrant, and just overall creates a much better experience in handheld mode.
- The kickstand is SO much better! Its the entire length of the switch and can be set at different angles. Just overall makes it feel a lot more sturdy and is what the original switch should have came with.
- The speakers are also much improved! They are frontward facing and produce a better more impactful sound.
- The OLED switch comes with 64 GB standard which is also much better than the 32 GB on the original switch.
- The improved dock on the OLED looks fantastic! Just some minor cosmetic improvements makes it look better, and I’d say overall the switch fits in their slightly more snug and secure than before.

OLED IN DOCKED MODE:
- The biggest complaint by everyone is going to be how the Switch OLED does nothing to improve the Switch’s performance in docked mode. There is no 4K or even HDR support which is very disappointing.
- That being said, if you use the Switch in docked mode 100% of the time than you likely will not see any benefits from the new OLED switch besides the larger storage.

FINAL VERDICT:
- For me, I use the Switch in handheld mode a lot. So the OLED Switch is an absolute home run for me. The screen, speakers, kickstand, just about everything about the handheld experience has been improved and I have really enjoyed using it.
- In my opinion, the OLED Switch is only $50 more than the original and completely justifies this price increase. Any new user who has never owned a Nintendo Switch should absolutely buy the OLED Switch! And if you already own the Switch but are curious about making the jump to OLED, you will not be disappointed whatsoever!",73,26

My kids dropped our last switch in the pool, and I couldnt fix the water damage cause they tried charging it wet and shorted out half the components. I went with this oled model cause I can see the difference in screens. Not only is it brighter, but its bigger, the speakers are better and the kickstand is better. So, if you play handheld more often than docked to a tv, it definitely shines in comparison to the older model. The battery is supposedly the exact same as the last model, but it does, and has been tested numerous times, last longer than its predecessor. Finally, the dock has an ethernet port, which is nice to have. Wifi is notoriously slow on the switch. Some may not be able to tell much of a difference with the screen, but its definitely worth the 50 bucks extra. I dont think i wouldve upgraded if our last switch didn't bite the dust, but if this is your first time to purchase one or youre replacing a broken one id definitely buy this one every time over the older model. Burn in isnt an issue with these no matter how much you play so that shouldnt be a concern unlike some oled tvs, or phones even. Definitely a good buy. I also suggest buying the hori split pad pro if youre gonna be playing handheld more often than docked. It almost cures hand fatigue, especially if you have bigger hands like I do, and you can still dock with them attached. Those are definitely a godsend. I wouldnt hold your breath for a price drop cause Nintendo is notorious for rarely dropping prices of these consoles and a lot of their 1st party games. You can get good deals on the games occasionally though. All in all, im happy with my purchase and recommended this oled model, but only if its your first switch, you're replacing one or maybe as a gift",0,0
134,Jessica,5,Upgrade from the original switch,18 hours ago,Definitely get the best buy geek squad. Its worth it i got my son the swith for xmas almost two years ago and the controllers quit locking in and i finally decided to take it in. Had i known it would be so easy i would have brang it sooner when it started breaking and before i bought 3 new controller sets and read my plan details that thwy would replace the original controllers. Anyways a week and a half later after dropping it off they called and said they were junking it out bc the didnt have the parts to fix it and were going to give me a refund to come in and pick up a gift card. So we received a $330 gift card (what we paid for the switch and tax) my son used that and his birthday money to upgrade to the oled. The screen has a way better picture and is bigger. And the kickstand on the back is better as well.,0,0

However I have some callouts to make. I had the original Switch and only upgrading because I play handheld alot. If your going to be mainly playing on the TV then upgrading isn’t worth it, as it’ll look the same on the TV as any other switch model! If your going to get a switch for the first time then spending a little extra for the OLED model is def worth it, unless you already know your always going to play on the TV then its not worth it.

Great battery life, it feels good and sturdy, overall it is just such an amazing system.

The OLED model is absolutely superb, with excellent image quality and a larger display than the original.

So, I personally opened and tried it on my own after the new year, and was genuinely surprised of how good the system while trying to learn some of its nuances. While it is not my primary choice of “play,” there are some exclusive games which I hopefully will enjoy after ordering them online this weekend. Thank you, BB, for keeping your customers informed after the store re-stock, as well as complying with my special request to put it inside in one of the generic brown bags to keep it inconspicuous after leaving the store for work, and keeping it in the car for the rest of the day.",0,0

226,Alberto,5,Great for First Time Switch or Money to Burn,8 months ago,If the PS Vita had an OLED screen this is what the Switch should have been at launch but here we are. If you already have a Switch and enjoy it then you should skip this upgrade. This model exists for first time buyers or those with disposable income. I play handheld 90% of the time so I had a Switch Lite but there was that 10% time when I wanted to play dock with friends. Sold my Lite and purchased this. Took some time to get used to the size (I sometimes miss the compactness of the Lite) but the OLED makes it all worth it. There are OLED torture tests on YouTube and based on their results I wouldn't be worried about screen burn in.,0,0

In others, it's just a good video game console. In even more other way it's a bad video game console. Are you curious to what ways it's great, good, bad at being a video game console? You should buy one and find out! 

This console reminds me of a story my grandfather once told me about a little boy who grew up wanting to be a doctor. When he was small the boy's grandfather died from an illness. The boy asked his father ""Why couldn't they save Pop-pop?"" His father replied ""Because there hasn't been a doctor great enough to cure the illness Pop-pop was stricken with."" From that day, the boy only had one life goal and that was to be the greatest doctor ever so HE could cure the illness and nobody would ever have to die from it again. 

That boy was me. And I make so much money as the greatest doctor of all time, I was able to afford the new Nintendo Switch  - OLED Model w/ White Joy-Con - White.",0,2

Had an original Switch from 2017 and despite not being the ""Switch Pro"" it is still worth picking it up as an upgrade. If this is your first Switch I also recommend picking this up if you're out and about a lot. The biggest difference between this and the original Switch is the screen and the kick stand. The new OLED screen really makes games pop out in color and I literally cannot go back to my original Switch's screen. A easy comparison is how in the early 2000's there was the Game Boy Advance and the Game Boy Advance SP. The SP having a button to brighten the screen and the now signature clamp design. However it still had the same tech on the inside as a regular Game Boy Advance.

The overall build quality of the device feels better than the original Switch, partially due to the vibrant OLED screen. The joy cons have not yet begun to drift, and as a primarily handheld user, I hope this is reflective of hardware changes made by Nintendo when manufacturing the newest Switches. The biggest improvement over launch day models is battery life. This may not be a big deal for people who dove into the Switch ecosystem after the first revision, but for anyone who are original launch owners who game primarily in the handheld mode, I can’t recommend the OLED enough. If you’re a version 2 or docked user, the upgrade isn’t as valuable and wouldn’t make sense unless your previous device stopped working.",0,0

Although it hasn't become a problem yet, I feel that it could be in the future as this has never been a thing with previous joycons that I've used. Besides that little kink, the switch is terrific. The screen quality and size really makes a difference from the original model in my opinion. The new kickstand is much better than the older model's as well, and battery life seems improved. On Best Buy's end, there was great service, up to date notifications for pickup, and prompt and helpful service at the store (Poughkeepsie).

299,ReviewRewardRepeat,5,Best Nintendo Switch model thus far.,10 months ago,"If you are interested in a switch and do not own one already... the OLED models are the ones to get now. Do not bother looking at the LCD models unless you get a bargain deal.

The bigger screen, better color reproduction, battery life, and dock with ethernet connection are well worth skipping over the last version.

If you already own a switch, the upgrade doesn't hold as much value in my opinion. Of course you could just sell your old switch to recoup some of that value if you really want the upgrades though. 

Definitely do not expect anything like upgrading from a ps4 to ps5 or anything like that. This is not a generational upgrade, only a revisional upgrade.",0,0

337,Noct,4,"2 Steps forward, one step back",1 year ago,"PSA: INSTALL A SCREEN PROTECTOR IMMEDIATELY BEFORE USING THE DOCK. 

Okay, I get it. The new OLED display is great, and the kickstand has been improved. That's about all, and if you have the old Switch, don't switch. Pun unintended. 

What I absolutely hate about this version: the screen scratches SO easily. They said it's compatible with the old dock. The first time I docked it, I was consciously careful about lifting it vertically; yet, it still scratched the screen glass. Fortunately, the scratch was only in the black bezel portion of the glass.  You can solve this problem with a tempered glass screen protector -- please buy one and install it immediately prior to use. I typically would do that for most electronics anyway, including the old Switch. 

The other thing I hate is the black plastic frame around the screen. It's a glossy plastic as opposed to the old matte design. It's a scratch magnet. This is going to look like a cheap toy if you are going to be using this undocked, which is ironic considering the upgrades to this version was meant to benefit undocked users. 

One last issue that I'm unsure if it's just a faulty joycon or the game I'm currently playing... but I have it docked to my TV and playing SMT5 with the white joycons that came with the switch. The right joycon tends to lag often. I will try to get another set of joycons to try and see what the deal is.

TLDR; get the old Switch, save $50 bucks.",2,1

They also have a 7 day free trial in case you are on the fence.

I honestly did not know what to expect. The games on offer are quite decent and whether as a handheld or docked on the tv, this has been a great experience. As a handheld, I can play it with the controllers attached or separated. This is so well done!

TIP: Do not connect to WIFI at house to transfer data from original switch to new OLED Switch. The original will not find the new one.

From the display to the new stand to how the joycons feel more firmly snug when attached, the Switch feels like a device for an adult rather than a toy for kids. 

But really, what makes the upgrade worth is the OLED screen. It is simply gorgeous and if you play in handheld mode at all it’s easily worth the upgrade. That being said, if you play docked most of the time, it’s not worth the upgrade. However, if you find yourself playing a healthy mix of handheld/docked, definitely consider selling your older model to someone who doesn’t care about this new one and get it. You’ll be glad you did.",0,1

However, just last week happened to see it on display side by side and that totally changed my outlook.... enough said. The screen is much larger than most YouTubers give credit and the contrast and colors really pop on this edition.

530,Techjunkie,4,more of the same with a slightly larger screen...,9 months ago,My Mario edition original Switch had USB port problems (the repair guy said it is apparently pretty common) and it would no longer output video to the tv. I replaced the dock and had everything cleaned and then had to take it to a Nintendo repair shop for the final bad news.  It charges but is basically a switch lite now since it can't dock and do anything on the tv.  Fast forward to seeing this and having some gift certificates about to expire and now i have an OLED version.  So for the only thing i notice that is different is a VERY slightly larger screen and a little longer battery life in handheld mode.  Honestly if you can find the original i'd just get it and save your money but the Switch is fun and has some exclusives that are solid plus my kids enjoy it so overall i'd say get one of the versions (not the lite).,0,0

I got this for my daughter. First let me say the games seem way overpriced. Nintendo is definitely cashing in on the nostalgia of their name. Second there isn’t a single fee for online use. There are multiple levels of membership which means more money. Third the game store is super laggy…. I mean really slow that it makes it unusable sometimes.  

To be honest I probably would have returned it as I was waiting to see how much my daughter actually played it but I accidentally went past the return date. Otherwise I probably would have returned the console.",1,0

The screen is a HUGE upgrade, and the kickstand runs the entire width of the body with much more position flexibility than the original.  On our original, the kickstand was broken off within a few months, but this one feels much more sturdy.  

The only downside is that our 3rd party travel docking cable does not seem to be compatible with the OLED, and appears to be a common issue, so if you plan on traveling and docking, you’ll have to bring the provided dock along with you.  The dock is also upgraded, with extra ventilation and an overall sleeker look.

879,SpookyMulder,4,Great for new Switch owners,1 year ago,"If you don't own a Switch and you'd like to get one, this is the best one to get. Great battery life and a beautiful OLED screen that's slightly bigger than the original. However, I can't in good conscience give 5 stars because it still has the joycon drift issue (if you're lucky, you won't run into this. But I have run into this on 3 different occasions with other switches). Also, I feel like there should have been more to this system to qualify it as an upgraded model.

All-in-all, if you're not interested in the Lite version, this is the one to get (assuming you can find one). But if you're an existing Switch owner and looking for an upgrade, you should probably stick with what you have unless money isn't an issue.",0,0

Very impressed with the screen. It also comes with double to storage from 32GB to 64GB. It also has nice external improvements such as the stand. Things like that matter coming from the flimsy OG switch version. Which I’ll keep as a collector. I would recommend to anyone looking to improve of you use it for handheld only.

1405,xCoOlGuYx,5,A MUST upgrade for unDocked users!,8 months ago,"Unfortunately, no one can be told how incredible this Display upgrade is. You have to see it for yourself. The vividness and color range is extraordinary and a giant leap for those who play mostly undocked. The screen size is also larger, and though it is only .8 of an inch larger (7” vs 6.2”) due to the shrunken bezel, fills the space better and is visually noticeable. Although there are no upgrades under the hood, the Display alone justifies an upgrade for mostly handheld users. fHowever, there are a few upgrades to the Dock, including a slight design change and addition of Ethernet port. An advantage if you play online, however at the expense of the upgraded display. In addition, the console itself has a few changes, including the system buttons, which increases the size of the power button and split volume rocker to volume up and down buttons; improved speakers which were moved to the bottom edge of the console but sound better; but more importantly a much needed upgraded kickstand similar to a Microsoft Surface. These upgrades do not revolutionize the console, but make it the definitive version if you do not, for some crazy reason, own a Switch and I cannot stress enough how much of an upgrade it is for undocked play. Lastly, there are a few caveats to consider. Even though the display was slightly increased, it does make the console slightly larger and will make certain accessories like pouches, carrying cases, and, more importantly, grips not fit. However, new accessories have been created for the OLED model, so make sure to look out for compatibility when outfitting your console.",0,0

The improved kickstand was my favorite feature by far since it allows me to prop it on my bed without fearing about it tipping over. Although it has double the storage at 64 gb, it’s not really much if you like to have an expanded digital game library. Joy-cons are the same as any other but I really like the aesthetic of having the white joy-cons with the black, metal frame. Shipping came a day early which is always an added bonus.",0,0

Docked there really is no difference outside of the great looking black/white theme while it is on the entertainment stand. Battery life is good for the rich display and game play use. I love the original switch that I got on launch day but this OLED should have been the one to launch those years back at this price or even maybe a little more. If this is your first switch, but it.

I wanted the previous Nintendo Switch when it came out, but glad I was able to get this version instead. I like that the screen is large, touch, and has vivid colors. I like that it comes with the necessary pieces to hookup with the tv out of the box, as well as the wrist strap attachments. I have not had a use for the controller accesory, however. The device reminds me of a smartphone with controllers attached, it seemed a bit heavy at first but it is comfortable now. Sometimes when just starting to play, the fan comes on, and is a bit loud, but not a major issue. 

I bought the online subscription, but have realized I have no use for it and the games weren't to my liking. After purchasing, I've realized that the nintendo eshop has a lot of games to purchase online, and offers deals all the time. So far, I have been playing Animal Crossing and the Taiko drums game. I find when using the joy cons, the controls don't seem to pick up my motions accurately when playing Taiko, but still very fun. I've purchased Ring Fit Adventure and it should be arriving soon, I hope I can get a better experience with the motions detection when I try it out.

Searching for a case that is dockable, stand accessable, doesn't have any grips and allows for the controllers to slide out has been a hard search. Putting it in a carrying bag, with a screen protector may be the only option for now.",0,0

2231,Me4aRZ,4,The SwOLED is a fantastic system!,1 year ago,"The Nintendo Switch OLED is a great addition to the Nintendo Switch family of systems. If you have a Launch Day Switch this would be a fantastic time to upgrade to this unit as it shares the same slight efficiency boost that the Switch.v2 (or commonly known as “Red Box”) received￼. The Screen itself is just so vibrant and honestly reminds me of the day I brought home the Launch Day Playstation Vita, everything is just crisp and pops. It has double the internal storage space up from 32GB to 64GB, which might not seem like a lot but it will help store a few extra eShop only titles to take with you on the go. The criticisms of the Switch remain the same and unaddressed as of this release; the download speeds are abysmal, if you’re planning on transferring over from another Switch and have a huge digital library expect to spend many hours waiting for your library to redownload. The system transfer process could definitely use refinement as some games do not allow save data to be backed up to the cloud or have an entirly arbitrary system, I’m looking at you Animal Crossing New Horizons. The eShop needs to be updated as it is more of a pain to navigate than it really should be with slow page scrolling, endless bloatware that abuses the eShops algorithims to put cheap smart phone￼ level games at the top of the Deals catagory and no real way to filter the eShop to find the real quality gems from reputable developers. At the nd of the day the Switch OLED is a great system, like those before it from￼ Nintendo and it will be money well spent for boundless entertainment.",0,1

Both of my adult kids have the Switch. My daughter had been trying to get me to buy one so we can play Animal Crossing together. I ended up buying one when she was here. I haven't put it down since I got it. 

Overall I love the portability of the system. The OLED screen is brilliant. The colors are very vibrant and the size of the screen is just right. 

Being able to hook the Switch up to my TV is also something I didn't know I wanted. Now I can play Zelda on a huge TV compared to what I used to play it on when I played the first one.

It's a great system and I look forward to playing it for as long as I have one.",0,0

I had played with a switch before but never got one myself because I know as with Nintendo History that a more advanced version would eventually be released and even though it was sad to not have a 4K dock like rumours talked about for years, this OLED Screen is SOO BEAUTIFUL!! I'm a techie and artist who loves my visuals so I have high standards in screens.

OLED screens generally are all good due to the tech allowing for deep to full black color values. This was SOO worth the wait because it's so vibrant, so deep of blacks you cant tell difference between display and bezel!, Twice the storage as old model so most people won't need to upgrade storage, a bigger screen so it actually utilitizes the amount of space it should have in the first place, the speakers are improved but most importantly the kickstand is the whole back bottom half with a beautiful and strong hinge so you have FULL angle control with reliability!

If you can afford it it's DEFINITELY worth the upgrade and if you don't have a switch this is the ONE to get!!!",0,0

2756,CasualReviewerPhotographr,5,Best Nintendo Switch thus far,1 year ago,"As a nintendo switch owner since original model's launch, the console quickly became my favorite (own most nintendo consoles, ps4 and xbox one).

The portability and ease of plug and play to tv is great.
Though some minor things made me feel it could be better, such as having sturdier joycon attachments when handheld, and a nicer screen (we are all spoiled by our smartphone screens).

Switch OLED fixed those complaints. Console as a whole feels sturdier, with more metal parts, and the OLED screen is on another level.
Contrast and color saturation feel even better than contemporary smartphones' screens. Screen is also slightly larger than original model, but when handheld is feels like an entirely new console.
Battery life is better than original model.

Only thing that time will tell is if new joycons present the same issues with drifting.

If you haven't bought a switch yet, this is the best model to get. For tv play it only holds advantage of dock built in ethernet port. But for handheld, this is by far the best console yet (brighter better colors than original ps vita, and all epic switch library).",0,1
2757,Kymander,2,Poor quality control. Screen blemishes,1 year ago,"I ordered a Switch OLED White from Best Buy. The screen has scuffs/imperfections around the bezel. It is very noticeable in light. I purchased a second one to see if I was just unlucky. My second one also had imperfections/scuffs around the screen bezel. This has to be something wrong with their production. I ended up buying a third one. The third one doesn't have many imperfections just very very small. I am finally keeping the third one and living with the imperfections. 

Poor quality control. I have owned the switch and the switch lite and neither of those had this issue. When paying $380 for a console, this shouldn't be an issue.",6,0

2783,PopoSheeSho,5,A Fabulous Upgrade for OG 2017 Switch Owners,1 year ago,"The sturdier frame, better/bigger/beautiful screen, improved battery, great kickstand, and increased storage make the OLED Switch a no brainer for people who play significantly in handheld and still have the OG 2017 Switch. It also finally gives an enjoyable/adjustable tabletop mode experience. 

It could be worth the wait for next gen/rumored Switch Pro if you have the 2019 V2 Switch though. You're still getting the same software experience and the V2 battery is just as good. Not to mention the V2 Switch has all kinds of special editions.

The ergonomics are definitely bad on the Switch though. A grip/case is a must for hands other than a child's. I've been enjoying the NeoGrip from Skull &amp; Co a lot this time around. I like that you can still use the kickstand while it's on (but know that it doesn't really work if you have the big grips on)..

My condolences to those who aren't/weren't able to snag one. The shortage sucks and scalpers are the worst. ='[",0,0

2787,3rettt,5,My favorite console,1 year ago,"The first thing I noticed was how beautiful the OLED screen looked. It has deep blacks and vibrant colors. Being able to play on docked mode with my TV as well as being able to take it on the go is a complete game-changer. There's some flexibility on how you can build your games collection. You're able to purchase games digitally on the Nintendo E-Shop or buy traditional game cartridges. There's such a wide collection of games that caters to both families looking for co-op or individuals looking for single-player games which makes the switch such a great purchase.

I do wish though that the switch comes with more internal storage. I anticipate needing to buy another SD card in the near future to hold my digital downloads. If you want to keep a physical collection, it isn't anything to worry about.

If you're looking for the best graphics and internals, you're not going to get it in the Switch. What you're really paying for is the Nintendo exclusives and flexibility to play it in docked mode or on the go.",0,0

This was honestly a splurge purchase and technically not necessary at all since I own an OG switch that I use docked only and a Lite that I take with me. A couple of reasons I decided on it was because the larger screen really does make a huge difference as do the deep colors displayed and the battery was a lot better than the Lite. If you do not own a Switch or are leaning towards the Lite I would just make the jump to OLED if you can afford it.

It also has a 7 inch screen caompared to the 6.2 inch on the base model. Even though both screen offer the same resolution displays, i think inches of the screen makes it look better and look more indepth when it comes to game on the oled.

That’s just me though.. if you’re considering purchasing a Switch, go OLED. The white is cute too and doesn’t get as dirty as I thought it might.

I grew up with a Nintendo 64 at home, played various Nintendo portables when I traveled. Gaming was my escape from the dredgery, and Nintendo was my outlet. Why I waited around 7 years since the debut of the Switch- or even worse, this version being out for months- is beyond me...

Handheld, table top, and docked mode all work perfectly on this console. The kickstand for table mode is even upgraded from the original design, making it very sturdy. The screen itself performs beautifully, with crystal clear color and details. Joy-cons may take a little getting used to if, like me, you've played on Sony consoles in your adult life. I will say that the controls are not too difficult to learn though.

My only (trivial) complaint is that the white Joy-Cons are not available outside of this package, especially if not counting knock-offs. It's best to get either an additional stand-alone set or another type of controller if you want to keep the included controllers clean and working properly.

Tldr: it's an awesome, versatile console that may spring up warm, fuzzy nostalgia",0,0

It was like wearing polarized sunglasses for the first time. It’s just freaking beautiful!

It feels good as a handheld and looks great because of the bright OLED screen.  When docked, I did not expect games to look as good as they do on my TV.  I am not entirely sure if it's because my LG CX is up-scaling content or perhaps due to the dock hardware (the dock that comes with the OLED version of the Switch has updated hardware over lesser versions) or both!

2888,RCB1,5,Incredible Upgrade from Original Switch,5 months ago,"I had buyers remorse almost instantly after buying this. Did I really need the OLED when I had an original switch? That all stopped the second I opened it. The larger and clearer screen was incredible. That along with the wide kickstand that adjusts allows me to ACTUALLY play it in tabletop mode, which is amazing. The one inch larger screen makes a HUGE difference. Screen looks amazing. Although not the main selling point, the white looks really nice. And lastly, the battery. Wow. It is at least twice as good as my original switch, if not more. When it comes to docking it to a TV, it is basically the same as my original switch. But on the go, this one blows it out of the water with the screen and battery. If you plan on playing the switch on the go a good bit, this OLED model is a no brainer. Just don’t forget to get a SD card since although it is upgraded from 32 GB to 64 GB, that is still really low if you have a good bit of games.",0,0

2917,Goalier95,5,AMAZING UPGRADE!,1 year ago,"As an owner of the original Switch that came out in 2018 or so, I was reluctant to repurchase something that I already had just because the screen size was bigger and had OLED. Watching reviews online DOES NOT do the screen justice! No stores had it on display so I could compare it to my original screen so I had nothing to go by except reviewers that raved about the awesomeness of the OLED screen. 

Just purchased it less than 24 hours ago and got it setup and transferred all my saved data from my old Switch (which was a painless process). Re-loaded my Zelda BTW game and.....WOW!! What a difference it made playing it again with the new screen - this was how Zelda and other top tier games should be played. The richness of the colors and deep blacks is just outstanding to view.

Since I have only played a few minutes and have not used the LAN dock feature I cannot comment on it. I only play the Switch in handheld mode but I'm sure it's a decent upgrade as well. 

One thing I will be getting is a glass screen protector since I've read that the screen still scratches easily so be careful if you don't use one. 

So if you don't have a Switch yet... this is the one to get. If you've owned the original one like myself, it's worth the upgrade seriously. I thought it wouldn't make a difference but it was glorious to play Zelda again. It's as if I needed eyeglasses for the longest time and finally got contacts or prescription glasses and the detail that I missed and saturation of colours just came ALIVE!! 

Sure it's not the Switch Pro with a faster processor or 4K but so what? I'm sure that version will be awesome but waiting for that in the future when you can play the games and enjoy it now is too good to pass up.",0,1

Granted playing some games will drain the battery quicker than others but on average you can game for a while before it needs to be recharged. The only thing I wish nintendo would do for future systems is make it a bit easier to get the games in and out of the system. I find it from time to time a little tricky trying to open the cartridge case just to get my games in or out. I personally don't use sleep mode when powering off my switch, because its still going to drain the battery, so I just turn it completelly off, which also needs to be changed on how to power off the system.

2928,timmc94,5,What the original should've been,11 months ago,"If you have the original Switch, and it still works just fine, you probably don't need this. That being said, I had the original and I got this... and I don't regret it!

The obvious bonuses are the new screen and kickstand. It's essentially the same device when docked, but in handheld mode the experience is far better with the OLED panel and the slimmer bezels. I don't often use the kickstand, but it's really good — especially since the predecessor's was a total joke.

There are other benefits too, and they're not advertised well so you may not be aware of them. First, the speakers are far better in this model! At full volume, it's quite loud — and there's actually decent bass now, which you needed external sound for on the previous Switch. The internal storage is doubled too (64 GB, up from 32) and it's finally a decent size for what it is. (Still get an SD card though... mine is 256 GB and it's so great to have!)

Lastly, battery life is phenomenal: the original died far too quickly, the silent revision was improved, but this blows both out of the water. When playing local multiplayer with a friend who has the revision of the original, we both started at 100% but when his was at 1% and needed to charge mine still had 29% left. I was also playing with higher brightness and volume settings than he was, and I turned mine on a few minutes before he did. Basically, this is a battery BEAST.",0,0

I love the new dock, the back piece being removable is way better than the swinging up and down of the prior model. Also the Ethernet port is a plus although I haven’t used it at the time of this writing . Also the buttons on the console itself (not the joycons) feel much more sturdier and don’t feel as cheap as the non Oled model. Honestly it’s worth the upgrade , even if you don’t play handheld all the time.",0,0

2932,Drazard,5,OLED display comes to Switch?!,10 months ago,"Was very excited to learn about the OLED display upgrade right after needing a second Switch at home.

The upgrade comes with a slightly bigger OLED display that makes colors pop, great for those who play undocked. Quality of life updates include the dock redesign to avoid scratching, but the added roominess may feel a bit shaky when docking the Switch. The Switch shell is now metal, but at the cost of the cartridge insert feeling a bit finicky when opening and closing it. The short stand is now a full-length stand, which is so much better in stability. No need for an external Ethernet adapter as it's now built into the dock.

You can now get it in black and white (much like the PS5) or in the good ol' neon red and blue. Transfer process was a breeze and I moved my games and Animal Crossing island without issue. The only annoying part was having to reregister my games on the home screen by plugging them all in one at a time, since I picked up a new MicroSD card.

Altogether, a definite upgrade for those who play portably and are looking for those quality of life changes, but for those who mostly stay docked, you're probably best off waiting for a trade-in deal or a potential future Pro model.",0,0

It is much more vibrant and clearer to play games on the screen. I really think the benefit of owning this oled switch is it being portable and for on the go. Other than just having it dock, then oled is out of the picture. I like the new dock, it more round on the top and the back door opens and unlatches from the main dock. The ethernet port is a nice feature, i think it is nice to take advantage of speed and stable connection or what not. I like the screen is much bigger, it feels premium and not cheap. 

if this is your second switch and you own one already, i think it not much of an upgrade but only for the experience of oled screen and only if you play in handheld mode all the time. Or if you have one already and you are giving the other one to your friend, kids, or family member than yes. If you have money to spare, sure why not. For the extra 50 bucks, i think it is really for the bigger screen and the oled feature with the ethernet port. Nintendo switch is a great system, but if you looking for major software or hardware upgrade, inside the nintendo switch, i say wait a couple more years or so until nintendo do 4k.  If you been wanting to upgrade or this is your first nintendo switch, i say go with oled switch, it will be a great experience. I wonder if nintendo switch is going the same route as the Nintendo 3ds. anyways. enjoy",0,0

2946,JonahCreed,5,Exactly What We Wanted and More,1 year ago,"To preface, the Switch OLED is aimed mostly towards people who play in portable mode primarily. The Switch OLED offers no benefits to those who play in docked mode, beyond the addition of the LAN port (Ethernet) in the new dock.

However, even if you primarily play in docked mode, you may change the way you play after getting this. The Switch OLED’s screen is beautiful. That’s even an understatement compared to the underwhelming screen on the original Switch. It is a night and day difference. 

Even more apparent than the gorgeous OLED colors is the screen size. Although, on a technical side, it is only slightly bigger, it makes a big difference. I cannot stress enough how much of an improvement the larger screen is. Games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Breath of the Wild benefit from this screen increase by making it easier to see inventory screens and smaller world-based details. 

The new stand on the Switch OLED is exactly what we should have had on the older Switch. The stand has a smooth resistance when opening and closing it, which helps you to situate it in just the right angle. It is sturdy. I wouldn’t worry about it falling over at all, unlike the last Switch.

In the end, I believe the Switch OLED is the perfect upgrade to anyone with an older Switch, or someone who primarily plays in portable mode. The upgrades, although relatively small, make a massive difference in gameplay enjoyment. If you manage to get your hands on one of these, you won’t be disappointed.",0,0

But the screen has deeper darks and brighter light colors, and has more pop to the picture.  I love the full body length kick stand.  The battery life is roughly double that of the original switch (v1).  I like the new cradle, it has an ethernet jack built in.

2956,June,5,Great Update if You Play Handheld!,11 months ago,"To preface this, I bought my OLED to replace my OG 2017 launch Switch. I only ever play my Switch in handheld, and when this was first announced I was skeptical if the upgrade would be worth it. My OG Switch was starting to show its age (with thousands of gametime hours) with battery life issues and loud cooling fans, so I took the plunge about a month after release. I can wholeheartedly say I LOVE THE UPGRADE. The smaller bezels and OLED screen are huge gamechanges for handheld players, the better sound and battery life is very welcomed as well! I can't speak to those who play docked, but for handheld users, the screen really does make a difference. My only small complaints are that 1) there seems to be some screen variances with slight green tint (does not effect gameplay however) and 2) because the OLED is ever so slightly wider, my Satisfye grip (as well as grips from other companies) will not work with it. Despite these two small quirks (again, they aren't major issues and don't affect how I enjoy playing) I'm incredibly happy with the upgrade.",0,0

The speakers sound better and the JoyCons feel much sturdier.  
The OLED model features a massively improved kickstand similar to the ones used on Surface Pros.
The new included dock features a physical internet port as well.

The Dock is better designed, it has a LAN port! No more slow downloading of games or updates over wifi now that you can connect via ethernet port. It's smarter designed w/the removeable cover plate in the back. Wire management is a snap.

So happy w/this upgraded purchase. (I had the v.2 &amp; the lite) If you can get your hands on this, I highly recommend.

Some ppl say the OLED switch is every so slightly thicker but I honestly can't tell nor have I paired it w/any protective cases or grips yet.

If you play on the go this is a must have, if you play mostly on a TV I'd say it's a personal choice to upgrade or not.

Honestly if you want to upgrade from the Lite, I would do it. Big price tag, but worth it",0,0

3037,SamH,5,Great for handheld mode,8 months ago,"It's your standard switch but with the absolute great screen upgrade. I thought I wouldn't be able to tell the difference but as soon as I played pokemon Legends Arceus on the OLED, I immediately fell in love with the handheld mode for it. The OLED really makes it worth playing games in handheld mode. Of course the screen is the only improvement for the switch so if handheld mode is your preferred mode, then yes the OLED is worth it. Other than that, a regular switch will be enough.",0,0
3038,Jott,5,A nice upgrade for those who are interested,7 months ago,"I really like this model. I was skeptical at first, because it's just a bigger screen, but I primarily play handheld, so it does make a big difference. The sound quality feels so much better as well (when playing handheld). I also really like that the kickstand is better designed, so it doesn't flop over right away, and the hinge for it is extremely adjustable, so you can on a small screen with friends more easily (and did I mention the larger screen? because the size helps with this part too). The memory inside is 64gb, compared to the other Switch models with 32gb, but most people would just buy a micro SD card anyways, so this is mostly negligible. The dock is also nice as well, the old dock wasn't bad, but the new dock has a built in ethernet slot so you can plug in an ethernet cord for a faster connection (depending on your internet). This replaces the USB port in the old dock, which was a USB 3.0 slot, but the Switch doesn't read 3.0+ speeds, so it's not like you're missing out on anything other than a spare USB port in the back. The white joycons are nice, your mileage will vary on impending drift experience. Overall, if you really have the money and already have an older Switch, and you like playing handheld, consider the slight upgrade/sidegrade, it's like upgrading a phone with a bigger screen size. If you have a Switch Lite and want to play docked, consider this. But if you have the first run Switch that is technically moddable, or don't feel like paying more for the few new features this model comes with, then stick to the OG.",0,0

3057,Tech0,4,Nice but not essential upgrade,1 year ago,"Decent upgrade, but not ""life changing."" Worth the extra $50 for users that play mostly handheld AND can appreciate the improved screen. That said the resolution is still 720p so, while the screen is bigger, brighter, more clear, it is not higher resolution. 

Aside from the improved screen, the OLED model offers a more stable kickstand and double the internal memory. However, 64GB still isn't enough over time. You will still need an SD card to store games if you buy games from the eShop. If you only buy game cartridges 64GB should be plenty.

The other central ""guts"" of the system are also the same as the previous models so if you mostly play docked then skip this version as you will experience no improvement whatsoever. The dock included with the OLED model features a LAN port to wire directly to a modem or router, if desired. That is the only material hardware difference between the two docks.

If you are considering a Switch for a younger child save the $50 and get the regular version instead since they are unlikely to recognize the difference between an LED and OLED screen or  the smaller bezel. For $50, they'd probably enjoy an extra game instead.",1,0

3071,Zella6,5,Great purchase.  If…,8 months ago,"Summary at bottom below the line:

It’s great! The OLED screen is a really nice improvement! MUCH more vibrant, and bigger. If you are buying your first Switch and you plan to play handheld at all, I feel like it’s worth the extra 50 dollars. The redesigned kickstand works better for tabletop mode than the old one. I don’t really use that but it’s still nice to know it’s there.  If you play online a lot, the Ethernet port may improve the stability of your connection in tv mode.  Overall it feels a bit more solid in your hands than the base model. Less creaky in your hands where the joycons connect to the unit. On paper the difference in screen size doesn’t seem that big, but when you are actually playing, it is a lot better. Most reviews I have seen, say that the speakers are improved as wel,l if only in their placement. I have not noticed that much difference, but it sounds good either way.
_________________________________________________________
If you already have a switch and play primarily on the TV you probably don’t need this.

If you already have a switch and play a decent amount of hand held, it is a nice NON-ESSENTIAL upgrade which I personally I’m very glad I made. After all you can still get around $200 or so for a base model switch, so you can recoup a chunk of your money.

If it’s for a little kid, they probably won’t appreciate the difference too much so I would go with a base model or a switch lite.

If you are a teen or an adult go with this model unless you really don’t care about handheld play.

3089,EvD1,5,Great Switch!  Lots to say,11 months ago,"If you’re able to snag yourself an OLED model definitely do. It is definitely worth the upgrade if you have a gen 1 switch. If you don’t have one at all definitely get this one if you are able to. The battery lasts longer than I thought it would. The screen is perfect and I wouldn’t worry about screen burn-in since I have seen people do tests with it leaving it on for weeks with no screen burn. The only thing that has happened with that test was that the screen didn’t appear as bright after the test.

The doc is a really nice step up. I love that the entire back comes off rather than it having a little hinge like the previous ones.  Apparently this doc has little upgrades hidden inside of it for future updates but of course don’t know for sure what that will mean for the OLED model. 

The joycons are the same as all the others just white.

The Switch is just slightly longer by a fraction of an inch. My OLED fits in a case I got that was intended for the older models so don’t worry about it not fitting unless your current switch fits really snug tight in the case and you upgrade to this one.

If you get this switch get a screen protector!!!  Can not stress that enough. So glad I got one for it because with all the upgrades with the doc, it still will scratch your screen. My screen protector got scratches on the far left and right of the screen protector after putting it in the doc a couple times. The screen is safe thanks to the screen protector.  Also this switch has a film over the screen already to protect it and you. When I say “and you” I mean that since the screen is glass and you drop it, the protective film that was put on it by Nintendo will keep the glass from scattering all over the place. Best thing to do is to not remove that protective layer. Never remove it!

One downside with mine that others probably have experienced with their switches OLED and older was that my left joycon’s joystick made a springy noise when I would rotate it to the top left position. This has happened to some people and I was one of the lucky ones for this to happen to.",0,0

I have the switch from the first revision, with the larger battery and more efficient processor that was released in 2019 so I'm not even coming from the original switch with the horrible battery life here.  

At first, I was hesitant to open the package, as I heard people mutter their bunk about this console not being worth the money.  However, after opening the thing and powering it on, I was very surprised by how much better the screen was over all previous versions.  To say it is beautiful, doesn't do it justice and it's bigger than the other switch displays.

The other thing that I find to be extremely interesting is the fact that Nintendo solved the only other issue I had with the switch...  They fixed the kickstand, so now you no longer need to set it on while you're playing SSB on the road with a friend.  

Now let me clarify my position here if you're somebody that plays the switch on the go, this screen is absolutely worth the price of admission.  If you only play it while docked, then this isn't for you.

Now if you're a parent that is on the fence between a switch OLED  and the other two new consoles on the market, then consider this...  There are far more exclusive games already available and worth playing for the switch, here are just a few.

Super Mario Odyssey
Super Smash Brothers
Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild
Splatoon 2
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
Mario Kart Live Home Circuit
Bayonetta 1 &amp; 2
Metroid Prime
Super Mario AllStars
Super Mario Maker 2
Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze
Pokemon Snap
Super Mario 3D World
Monster Hunter Generations
Monster Hunter Rise

These are just some of the great games worth playing on this platform and the Switch will be far easier to get this holiday season for sure.

3165,Chris,4,"The best way to play a 4.5 year old console, but..",1 year ago,"There are two groups of people that this product will appeal to, and as a result two different ways to review it. The first is as someone completely new to Nintendo Switch, and the second as someone who already has an older version. The five star recommendation is for someone who has never had a Switch before, and what I'll be talking about first. 

Nintendo games. Zelda, Mario, Pokémon, Fire Emblem, Xenoblade, Donkey Kong, Metroid, Splatoon, Smash Brothers, etc. You can't buy these games for any other current home console, and it can even be taken on the go with 4-5 hours of battery life. It's not a powerful console by today's standards, but it can still play at HD resolutions 90% of the time. 

The ecosystem is a less endearing. The eShop is cluttered, playing online requires a subscription, and you can't keep any legacy content offered on it - not to mention you may never get to play the old game you want to play at all. As an example, the Nintendo 64 system just got its first games on the platform over four and half years after it launched, and still has bugs. For N64, it's also an additional charge to the NES and SNES games. So not great. 

Overall, the Nintendo Switch's best qualities are its enormous library of incredible exclusive games, and the flexibility to play anywhere or any way you want to. Its biggest liabilities are a greedy parent company that knows many of its fans will be willing to pay any price for their services on their terms, and a relative lack of console power. There are reasons to be excited for Switch, but there are certainly aspects of its ecosystem that could be much better. 

For people that already own a Nintendo Switch, this version does not change much - especially when playing on the TV. I don't recommend getting it if you already have a Switch, unless you really don't mind the small upgrade and full price new console. This version adds a larger 720p OLED screen, doubles the storage, and changes a few things on the console structurally. The new Dock has a native ethernet port, however this will be available as a standalone purchase at another time.

3168,Nico07,5,Great upgraded Switch console,1 year ago,"While the Switch OLED Model isn't the Pro model many of had hoped for it does offer a few nice benefits that are great for newcomers and possibly worth the upgrade for others.  Basically, the big upgrade for $50 over the basic v2 red box Switch that has been out for a while is the new 7"" OLED over the older 6.2"" LCD screen.  The colors pop, contrast, and refresh rate are improved.  There is also no visible ghosting that was apparent on the older screen.  So as many reviews have said for mobile users this is great and a huge worthwhile upgrade.

Now for those like myself that primarily play in docked mode.  I rarely see this mentioned even in professional reviews of the console, but the internal system memory has been upgraded from 32GB to 64GB.  This is pretty big.  While you can buy an external MicroSD memory card for expansion, you can only have save data on the internal storage.  With games like NBA 2K series requiring 5GB per save and multiple profiles requiring multiple GB per save with games like Minecraft, more memory is very welcome.  This is especially true in that on the 32GB model with the OS the user only had access to around 26GB of this memory.

Aside from this the unit also features a new dock that has an integrated LAN port.  This is a bitter sweet upgrade as apparently the LAN port shares some of the same wiring as a 4K HDMI port that was added in a custom configuration.  So while it could have been interesting to have limited 4K support on the Switch, the LAN port is welcome, even if it also cost one of the two internal USB ports.",0,0

3255,Rhoney,4,Not the Switch Pro You Were Looking For But Close,1 year ago,I’ve always wanted to buy a Switch but was waiting for a PS4 Pro/Xbox One X type system upgrade before doing so. This system is unfortunately not that. But it is the best Switch ever made and well worth the price. The OLED screen is big and beautiful and does make the system feel more premium than the original model. Colors are brighter and all your favorite Nintendo games look fantastic. The white on black color scheme goes great with the PS5 and Xbox Series in my entertainment system. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the lack of a true update to the internals of the system. A 4K 60 FPS switch would’ve been amazing but this is all we got. Overall though it’s a must purchase if you don’t already own the Switch or only own the lite version.,0,2

DEFINITELY!! I decided to take the plunge and I must say that I do enjoy games more on this OLED model. The option of a more vibrant screen and a bigger screen is really a more dramatic difference than I thought it would be. And in addition, battery life is better than all previous models, tabletop is load more stable than the previous models, the sound is better (not majorly) but still better. And there is 32 more gigs of extra storage which no one could complain about. If you don’t own a Switch, no-brainer, get the OLED. If you have a previous Switch, sell it for like $200 to offset the price of the OLED. $150 for the OLED is a good deal. Or, use the old model to gift to a family member or even mod it for urself. The fact is, the price ain’t going down anytime soon so no point on waiting for a sale. And we have no idea when the true next-gen Switch is coming; it could be 1 year or maybe 3. But even if it is a year from now, that’s still a lot of time you can play on the OLED before the new one comes. I don’t regret my purchase at all.",0,1

But after playing on it for some time, it’s just enough bigger to fulfill a “sweet spot” I think the normal switch’s screen is just a tad too small. The improved kickstand is also super useful. I used the old kickstand on the normal switch maybe once or twice but with this new one I’m finding I’m using it much more often especially with the adjustable tilt. I also really enjoy having a dedicated onboard Ethernet port.  I would’ve definitely liked a more powerful Nintendo switch but this is a great upgrade nonetheless.",0,0

3268,flapjackashley,5,Excellent Upgrade for Handheld Players,11 months ago,"The Switch OLED has amazing upgrades and benefits for those who primarily play in handheld mode.  The OLED screen is a very big step up from the LCD, offers a larger viewing area, and is made of glass rather than plastic.  The screen quality is superb, and it is legitimately difficult to go back to an older model once you get used to the OLED.  Many games look so good that playing through them again on this screen is almost like a new experience.

That being said, the actual internals are no different from the non-OLED models, so you get no extra horsepower or boost.  If you play mainly docked on your TV, your benefits are limited to a newly designed dock that is not as tight of a fit, offers more ventilation for heat, and has a built in LAN port.   It would not be recommended as you will see no other benefits, and Nintendo sells the new dock on its own and the older models will worth with them.

One thing I don't like is the game cartridge slot. The original switch has a notch to open it while the OLED has no notch which makes it a pain to pop open if you have short nails.

A minor thing is the bezels are shiny black plastic which scratches at the slightest touch (even wiping with a microfiber cloth). You can only see them under bright light but knowing that the scratches are there still bothers me.",0,0

Best Buy did a second release of them the day after the console came out and I managed to get my hands on one and… simply WOW!! This new oled panel is definitely worth the upgrade IF you mainly play hand held mode! It feels so much more immersive than the original and colors on games such as BOTW pop! So bottom line is… if you primarily play in hand held mode and are ok spending the money, you’ll be very satisfied with this product.

I heard the OLED screen was gorgeous but I wasn't really prepared for how vibrant and large it was -- it absolutely fixes my tiny-font issue with both increased size and increased clarity. Get a quality hard case -- you don't want to scratch this one. The redesigned dock is smart and now includes an Ethernet jack, which is appreciated; I can still attach arcade sticks to the USB ports on the side of the dock.

But unless you're like me, have OCD, and need/want everything to look pretty with your other items, there's not much reason to buy this if you mostly play docked. If you mostly play on-the-go, the screen is a little bigger, the colors a little more vivid.

When I heard that Nintendo was going to release an updated model, aimed at handheld players, I was all over it.

First things first, do not pay scalper pricing. This thing is WORTH $350, but not anymore.

Secondly, the screen on this thing is amazing. While it is not that much bigger on paper, but it looks alot bigger in person. The colors are 150% better than the original's screen also. When I first got it, I was popping in games and just looking at how much better they look. The battery life is also significantly better.

If you are manly a handheld player and have a launch switch, I would say UPGRADE! We do not know when the ""Switch Pro"" is going to come, but this will definitely hold me off until then. BUY IT!",0,0

When there is a black pixel, it’s turned off rather than backlit like traditional LED panels. That combined with the technology of OLED and you have the most brilliant picture available.

Switch internet connectivity is kind of slow already, so having a wired connection is a must (especially if you're an all digital gamer).  The OLED screen is an improvement from the previous base model, and if you prefer to play in handheld mode most of the time, you'll really appreciate it.  I'd recommend this OLED model if you don't have a Switch at all, but if you already have a Switch, there's not enough here to upgrade for.",0,0

I never had issues with drifting, so I am hoping that's the case here. If you play mostly docked, even that has an upgrade. Ethernet built in at the cost of a USB port, but whatever.

It's super portable as well, and there are so many great games to choose from, especially the Nintendo exclusives like Pokémon and Mario.

3588,xFNx,4,What the Original should have been,1 year ago,"A fantastic upgrade or choice for those who prefer to play in handheld mode, but practically useless to those that always play docked. The only addition that would benefit such people would be the introduction of a lan port to the dock, which should have been part of the original design. Other great welcomed modifications such as the bigger screen (or more accurately, a thinner bevel around the screen) and the vastly superior kick stand should have also been a part of the originaldesign. The only thing that may not have been possible at the time of the consoles initial release is the OLED screen, which is incredibly vivid and makes up quite a bit for the Switch's lacking power. The primary disappointment with this new addition (other than an upgrade in cpu/gpu) is that lack of a pre-installed screen protector (tempered glass). The film that is factory installed is only to prevent the screen from shattering from impact and harming the individual cleaning it up, and provides no protection from scratches. This is quite disappointing since the screen is the only reason to get this model rather than the original model that is $50 cheaper, and a pack of 3-4 tempered glass plates only costs about $10 (I am noting the price not because I think they are to expensive, but to illustrate that they are cheap enough for Nintendo to pre-install them).",0,0

I ended up needing an SD card even with the available 50+GB useable. I really wish Nintendo would have used a white contrast on the system itself, like with the Mario red version. Instead we get an all black system and white joycons.

The screen is nice, and in general it's gots all the same cons and pros as any Switch. But I've noticed that this thing has more issues with freezing and crashing than the original Switch did, and even seems to load more slowly. For example, the process of opening the Nintendo eshop, searching a game, and buying it (should've taken around a minute) just took me 4 or 5 minutes. The shop took a weirdly long time to load, froze at one point so I had to close it, loaded slowly again, then spent 20 seconds or more with a blank white screen after I'd hit purchase before it finally took me to confirmation. Sometimes it runs things fine, but other times it seems to have issues like that which I don't remember with my other Switch. Overall it's  not bad, but if you're someone with a regular Switch thinking of getting the OLED version, I wouldn't bother.",0,0

Overall its a 4/5 for me. Having a ethernet port on the new dock is a nice addition and the portable upgrades are awesome, but it still could use a better internal chip for 4k output and just overall frame rate improvements on more demanding games.

3927,rystal,4,A Great follow up to the original,1 year ago,"A successful follow up to the original Switch, the OLED Model adds a much better screen, but should have taken over the $299 price point four years into this console cycle.


Everything you love about the Switch system, with a slightly larger and better overall screen. Your games will look amazing. Suggest picking up Metroid Dread with it for a game that was designed to take advantage of the system fully. The other major factor that makes this system 'better' than the launch model is the long and better stand on the back of the system. 

While the system improvements otherwise are few and far between. Again I reemphasize that the system is a good medium improvement, but should have been at the $299 price point but  lets be honest: Nintendo doesn't even have to try at this point to make people buy a Switch so of course they capitalized.",0,0

The screen is substantially better than the original model. It's larger, brighter and sharper with much more vibrant colors. Honestly the old Switch looked fantastic already for a 720p screen, but this one blows it away. It is a tiny bit wider and maybe heavier, but nothing noticeable. The white controllers and dock are nice touch as well. And I love the kickstand. It can go to any angle now, which was one of my biggest complaints. They've also improved the speakers which sound louder and clearer. But if you only play your Switch in docked mode, this is pointless to own. But if you play in handheld, don't mind the price tag and must own the very best, this is a good upgrade.",1,1

I haven't played a lot of handheld since COVID started, so this is partly a speculative choice. I upgraded from a launch-day switch, so I presume I'll be happy with the increased battery, too. 

But I don't know if I would recommend someone upgrade to this unless it makes sense for you financially, you can pass along your original Switch to someone else, and you will play handheld often.

4449,RSas,2,The Screen Isn’t that Big of a Deal,9 months ago,"If you already have a Switch, this isn’t worth the upgrade. 

The OLED screen is nice but it doesn’t change that much in most games. Is it better? Sure. Is it 200$ “better”? No. 

Honestly, if there was a program to exchange old Switches for OLED for maybe 50-100$, I’d recommend it to everyone but if you sell original switch, you’ll only have 150$ or so… while this one is 350$ plus tax. 

The low quality textures, poor PPI and resolution dipping below 720p with framerate dipping into 20s is just not acceptable no matter how good the first-party Nintendo games are. 

Judging by the amount of revisions we got with 3DS (original, XL, NEW 3DS, New 3DS XL, 2DS, new 2DS XL), OLED won’t be the last one. It seems like a replacement for the basic version of the Switch… so hopefully a powerful revision is on the way. The games deserve more than what the system limits them to.

Other than that, if this is your first Switch console, of course it’s better to go with OLED. Ideally, find a way to look at both . I personally didn’t think that OLED screen makes that much of a difference. It’s better but remember, the you tubers who say it’s “mind-blowing” aren’t buying these with their money, they get paid for keeping promotional items and reviewing them, so of course every new tech for them is “a must”.",4,0

5533,Searching,5,Switch Definitive Edition,11 months ago,"Even though the Switch has been out for over 4 years now it still feels like a very relevant console today.  I bought a V1 Switch back in 2017 and upgrading to the OLED is like night and day difference.  The bezels around the screen have shrunk and the OLED panel just makes the games pop.  The kickstand is actually usable now and overall the build quality has noticeably improved.  Because this is OLED technology it does draw less power which means longer battery life!

I would say purchase this console if:

- you don't own any versions of the Switch
- you own a Switch Lite and want to upgrade
- you own the original 2017 model and you want to upgrade
- you have money

This isn't the Pro version with a better CPU that everyone thought we were going to get and if you already own a Switch and primarily play in docked mode then you can probably pass on this one.  

PSA:  Nintendo does state that you can use the OLED Switch in the original dock and while it does work I would not recommend doing so.  The intake vents are placed differently on the new console and I have noticed it getting dramatically warmer using the original dock.  Most likely the system is having trouble pulling in air since the vents are obstructed.  The OLED dock however has specific cut outs to accommodate for both the OLED and original Switch. 

Overall this is a nice hardware refresh and I would recommend this to anyone that has the slightest passing interest.",0,0

The screen did not have any protection on it when I opened the box which I thought was weird but thought maybe thats how Nintendo sends them out. The screen had TONS, and I mean TONS of water marks or dried up spit marks that you often see on screens or monitors after years of use without cleaning. It was disgusting but again, its so hard to get and find I sucked it up and did the best I could to clean it.

5637,Cris,5,Best Switch Out Right Now,1 year ago,"I was one of the lucky few to get my hands on the new OLED edition after launch. What I really admire and enjoy about this edition is the screen. Bigger, brighter and beautiful. Enjoy the fact it has an option to change from vivid to standard quality. The speakers are now in the front of the screen and sound better than before. Battery so far is doing awesome and enjoy the new look of the dock.

Now what I dont like.
After setting up my switch and attaching my joy cons to the screen. The right joy con tends to get stuck, like a bit of force is needed to slide it off its track. Kind of odd. Also the feel of the joy cons are off. I got my hands on the first switch at launch back in March of 2017 and the joy cons felt great. Nice soft , matte finish. These new joy cons feel more plastic. They just feel cheap to me.
Overall, really happy with my new switch. Will enjoy it and take care of the OLED screen. Heard OLED screens are prone to burn-ins so I will do my best to avoid that.
Thanks for reading.",2,0

5640,Kitty,4,Beautiful screen but made me nauseous,1 year ago,"The screen on the OLED Switch is beautiful, but it made me feel weird after playing on it a while. The fast movement combined with bright colors in games were making me nauseous. I’m in the minority but I feel the screen is too big and bright for close up handheld play so I’ll be sticking to my old switch. My family however are enjoying the bigger screen. Four stars because it really is a decent upgrade, but it’s not for everyone. Just wanted to give a different point of view.",0,1

5644,JoshB,5,Amazing system!,1 year ago,"I don’t even know where to start. After owning a regular Nintendo switch for 4 years, I can definitely say this is a huge upgrade! Automatically as I turned on my switch oled, I could see a difference in color and quality. The colors pop out so much more and the quality feels so much in better. Better screen and the back doesn’t track as much finger prints as the regular switch if that’s a big deal to you. The kickstand is strong. Overall I definitely recommend the system!",0,0

Stand is robust, easily adjustable but stays put. Just mountains better experience. My old switch feels so antique compared to this one. Everyone should upgrade, unless it stays docked 100% of the time. I love it, just wish downloading was faster - big issue when lots of games. I guess LAN only improves online game stability. And wish some games like Doom had crisper graphics. The Switch 2 has some room for growth, but this is a very good upgrade.",0,0
